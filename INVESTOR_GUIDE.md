## 📊 DEMO SCRIPT (5 Minutes)

**Minute 1-2: Patient View**
"This is what consumers see - a lifestyle-first health dashboard. Notice the health score, mood tracking, and personalized content. Users can discover practitioners, track habits, and shop wellness products."

**Minute 3: Practitioner View**
"Now switching to practitioner mode - same app, completely different experience. Providers see their patient roster, manage appointments, and access practice tools. They pay a monthly SaaS fee to access the platform."

**Minute 4: Researcher View**
"Finally, the researcher view shows our data platform. Scientists can browse datasets, run custom queries, and collaborate on publications. This is our highest-margin revenue stream."

**Minute 5: The Network Effect**
"Here's the magic: More patients mean more data. More data attracts researchers. Researchers pay for insights that help practitioners provide better care. Better care attracts more patients. It's a self-reinforcing cycle."
